# ToolCollection
## Idea
The idea behind the project is to be a collection of a lot of small tools that can be used over command-line, a GUI via Desktop (Windows and Linux) or an app on mobile phones (Android). The individual tools provide a compact way of learning about specific aspects of coding without a larger coherent project behind it.

## Tools
In the following, tools are presented that are already implemented, are in development or are planned to be included in the ToolCollection.
### Backupper (in development)
Allows the user to backup individual files, folders or a list of both into an archive that is saved at a given path. The list of files and folders should be given to the tool in form of a YAML file. The user should also be able to add/remove paths from the YAML file via command-line and via a GUI.

Status:
- [ ] Command-line usage
- [ ] Desktop GUI
- [ ] Android App
