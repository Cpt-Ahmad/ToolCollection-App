# ToolCollection-App
## Idea
This project should contain a lot of different small tools that can be used on a variety of devices. The idea behind it is to get an understanding of how specific features can be implemented without a bigger picture in mind.

## Platform and Programming Language
Every tool inside the ToolCollection should be usable from command-line and also have a GUI for Desktop (Windows and Linux) and Mobile (Android). To achieve easy cross-compatibility all tools should be written in Kotlin or Java.
